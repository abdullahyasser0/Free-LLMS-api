            "The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is one of the most profound and enduring philosophical inquiries. Different traditions, philosophies, and individuals have offered varied answers over time. Here are some perspectives:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. **Philosophical Perspectives**  \n",
            "   - **Existentialism (e.g., Sartre, Camus):** Life has no inherent meaning; it is up to each individual to create their own purpose through choices and actions.  \n",
            "   - **Absurdism (Camus):** The search for meaning in a meaningless universe is absurd, but one must embrace life passionately anyway.  \n",
            "   - **Stoicism:** Meaning comes from living virtuously, accepting what we cannot control, and focusing on inner tranquility.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Religious/Spiritual Perspectives**  \n",
            "   - **Theism (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc.):** Life’s meaning is tied to divine purpose—serving God, fulfilling a spiritual journey, or achieving salvation/enlightenment.  \n",
            "   - **Buddhism/Hinduism:** Meaning arises from self-realization, breaking free from suffering (dukkha), or merging with ultimate reality (Brahman).  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. **Scientific Perspectives**  \n",
            "   - **Evolutionary Biology:** Life’s \"purpose\" is survival and reproduction, but consciousness allows humans to seek higher meanings.  \n",
            "   - **Cosmology:** On a universal scale, life may be a rare fluke—meaning is ours to define.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. **Personal/Pragmatic View**  \n",
            "   Many find meaning in relationships, creativity, helping others, personal growth, or leaving a legacy. Viktor Frankl’s *Man’s Search for Meaning* suggests meaning emerges from suffering, love, and purposeful work.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### Ultimate Answer?  \n",
            "There’s no single objective answer—it’s a deeply personal quest. The beauty lies in the freedom to explore, define, and redefine what gives *your* life meaning.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Would you like to explore a specific angle (e.g., science, philosophy, spirituality) further?\n"
