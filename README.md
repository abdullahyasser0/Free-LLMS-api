## Sample: Groq API

> üìç Refer to the notebook and scroll to the **Groq API** section.

- **Models:**  
  Hosts open-source models like **Llama 3.1 (8B, 70B)**, **Gemma 2**, and **Mixtral**. Known for **high inference speed** due to custom hardware (**Language Processing Unit**).

- **Free Tier Limits:**  
  200‚Äì14,400 requests/day depending on the model.  
  **Llama 3.1 70B** available with free tier on providers like **OpenRouter** or **Together AI**.

- **How to Access:**  
  - Sign up at [Groq‚Äôs website](https://console.groq.com/)  
  - Or use third-party providers like [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)  
  - Simple API integration via REST or libraries like `requests`

- **Best For:**  
  - High-speed inference  
  - Chatbots  
  - Lightweight applications needing fast responses
 

## Sample: OpenRouter API

> üìç Refer to the notebook and scroll to the **OpenRouter API** section.

- **Models:**  
  Aggregates multiple open-source LLMs, including **DeepSeek R1**, **Llama 3.2**, **Qwen 2.5**, **Mistral**, and more. Acts as a **unified interface** for various providers.

- **Free Tier Limits:**  
  Free access to models like **DeepSeek-V3**, **Llama 3.1**, and **Qwen** with token-based limits (varies by model).  
  $1‚Äì$5 credits often provided upon signup for testing.

- **How to Access:**  
  - Register at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)  
  - Configure API keys  
  - Easily switch between models using a **single base URL**

- **Best For:**  
  - Experimenting with multiple LLMs  
  - Centralized access without managing separate accounts

- **Notes:**  
  - Free tier is **token-limited**  
  - Optimize prompts to stay within limits  
  - Some models may have **regional restrictions**

- **Notes:**  
  - Free tier is limited by daily requests  
  - Heavy usage may require paid credits  
  - Ideal for developers needing **ultra-fast** responses
